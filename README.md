hello,everyone

It's really a great honor to let me introduce this system for you.

The system is use to finish my undergraduate study,It include a lot of technology such as Vue,Springboot and  Hadoop,the  front terminal and the behind terminal also from GitHub,but I didn't find it again,so very thanks for opening project offer help for my project.

In this system,you can find a Item-CF algoithm for recommend ability,because of the limit of my ability, It just can running on the windows,can't execute in the Linux.More than,running this system also need install Redis and MongoDB,Redis as the userdata cache,MongoDB as the database for userlog. 

```vue
#the front of system
npm install 
npm run serve
```
